# PROJECT OVERVIEW


The Netflix homepage project aims to replicate the user interface of Netflix using HTML and CSS. It will feature a responsive design for various screen sizes. The page will include a header with navigation links, a hero section displaying featured content with a play button overlay, and sections for trending movies and TV shows. CSS will be used for styling, including grid layout for content organization and media queries for responsiveness. This project will focus on achieving a visually appealing layout that closely resembles the Netflix homepage, enhancing skills in HTML structure and CSS styling.
